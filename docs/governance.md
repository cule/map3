This document aims to clarify how decisions of Map3 are made and how various
stakeholders of our community interact with each other, including the relationship 
between open source collaborative developments and other efforts that may be funded by
for-profit or non-profit entities. The Software developed by The Project is released 
under the Apache License 2.0 (or similar) open source license, developed openly and hosted 
in public GitHub repositories under the [Hyperion GitHub organization](https://github.com/hyperion-hyn).
Examples of Project Software include Map3, Map3 Edge, Map3 Edge Dashboard etc. 

## Map3 Governance

### The Project
The Map3 Project (The Project) is an open source software project. The goal of The Project is to develop open source software and deploy open and public service nodes and services for decentralized and autonomous
mapping and map services. The Services run by the Project consists of public websites and node-services
hosted under the *map3.network domain.

The Project is developed by a distributed team of developers, called Contributors. 
Contributors are individuals who have contributed code, documentation, designs, user support, 
or other work to one or more Project repositories. Anyone can be a Contributor. 
Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors participate in the 
project by submitting, reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating 
in open and public Project discussions on GitHub, Stack Overflow, Telegram chat rooms, and mailing lists. 
The foundation of Project participation is openness and transparency.


The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the Project. 
Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project Community and 
we strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as low as possible. In the scope of Map3, 
Users include Node Operators, Content Providers and Service Users. 

### Governance

This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.

The foundations of Project governance are:

-   Openness & Transparency
-   Active Contribution
-   Institutional Neutrality

The Project leadership is provided by a designated subset of Contributors called Core Developers, whose 
active and consistent contributions are recognized by their receiving ownership rights over the GitHub organization.
In general, all Project decisions are made through consensus among the Core Developers with input from the
Community. The Core Developers in other words will also be the Steering Council of the Project. 

### Steering Council
The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Project Contributors who have 
produced contributions that are  substantial in quality  and quantity, and sustained over 
at least one year. The Council consists of the owners of the project organization as well. 
The overall role of the Council is to ensure, through consensus and taking input from the 
Community, the long-term well-being of the project, both technically and as a community.

During the everyday project activities, members participate in all
discussions, code review and other project activities as peers with all other
Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Members
do not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the
Council. However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of
their contributions and their expert knowledge of the Project Software and
Services that Council members will provide useful guidance, both technical and
in terms of project direction, to potentially less experienced contributors.

The Council and its members play a special role in certain situations.
In particular, the Council may:

-   Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of the
    project.
-   Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or
    individuals.
-   Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull
    requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process
    and merging pull requests.
-   Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage
    those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.
-   Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus
    on an issue in a reasonable time frame.

### Council Membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member, an individual must be a
Project Contributor who has produced contributions that are substantial in
quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one year. Potential Council Members 
are nominated by existing Council members and voted upon by the existing members after asking 
if the potential Developer is interested and willing to serve in that capacity.

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a
comprehensive view of their contributions. This will include but is not limited
to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation,
community help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are
deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like “100 commits in
this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than
the project’s overall well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of
backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we explicitly do
not define code as the sole metric on which council membership will be
evaluated.

If a Council Member becomes inactive in the project for a period of one year,
they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before removal, inactive
Member will be approached by one of the Core Developers to see if they plan on returning to
active participation. If not they will be removed immediately upon a Council
vote. If they plan on returning to active participation soon, they will be
given a grace period of one year. If they don’t return to active participation
within that time period they will be removed by vote of the Council without
further grace period. All former Council members can be considered for
membership again at any time in the future, like any other Project Contributor.
 Retired Council members will be listed on the project website, acknowledging
the period during which they were active in the Council.

The Council reserves the right to eject current Members, 
if they are deemed to be actively harmful to the project’s well-being, and
attempts at communication and conflict resolution have failed.

### Conflict of interest

It is expected that the Council Members will be employed at a wide
range of companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this,
it is possible that Members will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of
interests include, but are not limited to:

-   Financial interests, such as investments, employment, or contracting work,
    outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.
-   Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially
    leak into their work with the Project.
-   An issue where the person privately gains an advantage from The Project
    resources, but The Project has no gain or suffers a disadvantage.

All members of the Council, shall disclose to the rest of the
Council any conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of
interest in a particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that
issue, but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue. 

### Private communications of the Council

Unless specifically required, all Council discussions and activities will be
public and done in collaboration and discussion with the Project Contributors
and Community. The Council will have a private mailing list that will be used
sparingly and only when a specific matter requires privacy. When private
communications and decisions are needed, the Council will do its best to
summarize those to the Community after eliding personal/private/sensitive
information that should not be posted to the public internet.

### Subcommittees

The Council can create subcommittees that provide leadership and guidance for
specific aspects of the project. Like the Council as a whole, subcommittees
should conduct their business in an open and public manner unless privacy is
specifically called for. Private subcommittee communications should happen on
the main private mailing list of the Council unless specifically called for.

### Changing the Governance Documents
Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull
request to The Project's governance document on GitHub. The pull request 
is then refined in response to public comment and review, with the goal 
being consensus in the community.  After this open period, a Steering Council 
Member proposes to the Steering Council that the changes be ratified and the 
pull request merged (accepting the proposed changes) or proposes that the pull 
request be closed without merging (rejecting the proposed changes). The Member
should state the final commit hash in the pull request being proposed for acceptance 
or rejection and briefly summarize the pull request. A minimum of 80% of the 
Steering Council must vote and at least 2/3 of the votes must be positive to 
carry out the proposed action (fractions of a vote rounded up to the nearest 
integer).
