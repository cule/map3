# Contributor Code of Conduct

**Map3** is a decentralized map network which aims to be **impartial**, **secure** and **extremely robust**. Map3 is **free from control**, **free to participate**, **free base map**.

We envision Map3 to be entirely built for and governed by the global Map3 community.

As contributors and maintainers of the Map3 project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by launching Map3 node, using Map3 network, providing feedback, propagation, recommendation, posting issues, contributing code, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, and any other activities.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, body size, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the Map3 project to do the same.

We encourage participants to create a positive and constructive environment by:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behavior by participants including:
- Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Map3 project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at [conduct@hyn.space](mailto:conduct@hyn.space).
